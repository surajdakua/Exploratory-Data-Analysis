# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## EDA of Haberman Dataset.
  - Haberman Dataset/Kaggel to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
  - EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modelling and also summarize the data characteristics often       with visual methods.  
  - EDA can be also used for better understanding of data and main features of data.
  - Machine learning is more about getting insights of data that is very very important.
  - In machine learning is not about how much lines of cde you write but it is about how much richness you bring to the             analysis of the data.
